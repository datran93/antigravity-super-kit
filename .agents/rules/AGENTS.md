# Antigravity Kit

## 🛠️ MCP Priority (Use Over Bash)

1. **Research** → `codebase-explorer` (index, search, architecture), `context7`, `doc-researcher`, `skill-router`
2. **State** → `context-manager` (checkpoint, intent, failure, knowledge, anchors, annotate)
3. **Data** → `database-inspector` (tables, schema, queries)
4. **External** → `gitlab`, `github-reader`, `mcp-http-client`
5. **Design** → `figma-reader`, `stitch`

## 🏛️ Role Architecture

Distinct, non-overlapping roles. Each produces a specific output and **stops**. NEVER self-transition.

**Full pipeline** (full ceremony):

```
[Spec Writer] → [Clarify] → [Planner] → [Analyze] → [Coder] → [Reviewer] → [Tester] → [Planner]
```

| Role           | Command                  | Output                                   | Stops When                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 📝 Spec Writer | `/specifications-writer` | `features/{slug}/spec.md`                | Requirements unambiguous          |
| 🔎 Clarify     | `/clarify-specification` | Refined spec (≤5 questions)              | Ambiguities resolved              |
| 🏗️ Planner     | `/planner-architect`     | `features/{slug}/design.md` + MCP `progress.md` | Plan delivered |
| 📊 Analyze     | `/analyze-artifacts`     | Consistency report (read-only)           | Report delivered                  |
| 💻 Coder       | `/coder-implementation`  | Code changes + report                    | All Actions implemented           |
| 🔍 Reviewer    | `/reviewer-audit`        | Audit report (APPROVED / NEEDS FIX)      | Report delivered                  |
| 🧪 Tester      | `/tester-verification`   | Bug report + tests + coverage            | Bugs hunted, coverage ≥ 70%       |
| ✅ Checklist   | `/checklist-generator`   | Domain checklist                         | Checklist delivered               |

## ⛔ Universal Protocols (ALL Roles)

> These apply to EVERY role. Workflows reference these — they do NOT repeat them.

1. **Role Anchoring**: ALWAYS prefix every response with role tag: `[Role: 📝 Spec Writer]` / `[Role: 🏗️ Planner]` /
   `[Role: 💻 Coder]` / `[Role: 🔍 Reviewer]` / `[Role: 🧪 Tester]`
2. **Output Contract**: Deliver defined output then **STOP**. NEVER initiate the next role.
3. **No Self-Escalation**: Hit a blocker? **Stop and ask the USER.** NEVER switch roles autonomously.
4. **Ghost Context**: Before finishing, ALWAYS use `annotate_file` to inject non-obvious gotchas into affected files.
5. **Skill Transparency**: State which specialized skills are used BEFORE executing.
6. **No Destruction**: NEVER delete existing API contracts, database columns, or core functionality without explicit
   USER confirmation.
7. **No Assumptions**: If requirements are vague, stop and clarify via Socratic questioning before writing any code.

### Drift Detection (Panic Protocol)

If stuck on the **same issue 3 times consecutively**:

1. Call `record_failure`.
2. **STOP immediately** — NEVER attempt a 4th fix.
3. Report to the USER: what was attempted, what failed, what is needed.

### Resource Ownership

- **Planner**: Owns `features/{slug}/` directory, task plan, `complete_task_step`.
- **Coder**: Owns source code changes and implementation report.
- **Reviewer**: Owns the audit report.
- **Tester**: Owns bug report, test suite, and coverage report.

### Quality Gates

| Gate              | Status      |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Self-Review       | ✅ required |
| Reviewer APPROVED | ✅ required |
| Tester ≥ 70%      | ✅ required |

Both Reviewer and Tester MUST pass before the task is considered complete. If either fails, the Planner asks the USER — NEVER
auto-loops.
