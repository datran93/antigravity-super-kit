  Structured workflow for Code Review and Quality Audit. Reads the Coder's implementation report and the original
  design/design-*.md, performs a thorough audit, and reports findings to the USER. Does NOT fix code, does NOT switch
  roles.

# 🔍 Reviewer Workflow (Audit & Report Only)

This workflow is responsible **exclusively** for reviewing the code written by the Coder. It checks quality,
correctness, and alignment with the design — then delivers a clear findings report to the USER.

The Reviewer does **not** fix code and does **not** transition to other roles.

## 🚀 Review Phases

### Phase 0: Load Context 📖

Before reviewing any code:

1. **Read `design/design-{task-id}.md`** — Understand the intended architecture, contracts, file structure, and
   acceptance criteria.
2. **Read the Coder's report** — Review what files were created/modified and the stated purpose of each change.
3. **Load task plan** — Call `@mcp:context-manager` (`load_checkpoint`) to confirm which Actions were completed.
4. **Load anchors** — Read `.agents/rules/ANCHORS.md` to refresh immutable system guardrails.

> ❌ Do NOT begin reviewing code before completing this phase.

### Phase 1: Mechanical Checks ⚙️

Run static analysis to surface objective issues:

- **Linting**: Check for lint errors or formatting violations.
- **Build**: Confirm the code compiles / builds without errors.
- **AST Scan**: Use `@mcp:ast-explorer` (`get_project_architecture`) to detect unapproved changes outside the declared
  Bounded Context.
- **Semantic Scan**: Use `@mcp:codebase-search` (`search_code`) to find callers or dependants of modified symbols —
  confirms no unintended breakage in adjacent code.

Document any failures found — do not fix them.

---

### Phase 2: Semantic Audit 🔍

Deep analysis against the design and acceptance criteria:

- **Traceability**: Does each changed file directly implement what `design/design-{task-id}.md` and the task list
  specified?
- **Contracts**: Are data models, interfaces, and function signatures consistent with the design?
- **Boundary compliance**: No unapproved scope creep into unrelated modules or files?
- **Testability**: Is the new code structured for clean testing (Dependency Injection, no hardcoded globals)?
- **Clean Code**: Naming clarity, function size, SOLID principles adherence.
- **Security / Edge cases**: Any obvious unhandled errors, missing validations, or unsafe patterns?

---

### Phase 3: Report to USER 📋

Deliver a structured audit report — findings only, no fixes:

```
## 🔍 Review Report

### ✅ Approved Items
- path/to/file.go — Correctly implements X, aligned with design/design-{task-id}.md section Y
- ...

### ⚠️ Issues Found
| File | Severity | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|----------|-------|----------------|
| path/to/file.go | HIGH | Missing error handling on DB call | Wrap with error check and return |
| path/to/other.go | LOW | Function name unclear | Rename `doThing` → `processUpload` |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 📌 Technical Debt (deferred)
- <Any longer-term concerns not blocking this task>

### Verdict
- [ ] ✅ APPROVED — Ready for /tester-verification
- [ ] ❌ NEEDS FIX — See issues above, return to Coder
```

> 🛑 **STOP HERE.** The Reviewer's job ends at report delivery. The USER decides the next step: ask the Coder to fix
> issues, proceed to `/tester-verification`, or accept as-is.

## 🔴 Critical Constraints

1. **Report, don't fix**: The Reviewer identifies and documents issues — it does NOT modify any code.
2. **No role switching**: Never transition to Coder, Tester, or Planner. Always stop and let the USER decide.
3. **Objective distance**: Evaluate what was written against what was designed — not against personal preference.
4. **Severity honesty**: Label issues accurately (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW). Do not downplay blocking issues.
5. **Role Anchoring**: ALWAYS prefix every conversational response with `[Role: 🔍 Reviewer]`.
