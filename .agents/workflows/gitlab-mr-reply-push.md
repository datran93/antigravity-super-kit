# Reply and Push GitLab MR Fixes Workflow

This workflow automates the second half of addressing a GitLab Merge Request (MR) feedback: committing and pushing the
local changes, then replying to the reviewer and marking the discussions as resolved.

## Requirements

- You must have already completed the `/gitlab-mr-read-fix` workflow (or applied fixes manually).
- The `@mcp:gitlab-mr-discussions` server must be configured.
- You must know the Project ID, Merge Request IID, and the specific Discussion IDs you wish to reply to.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Commit and Push Changes** Stage the modified files, commit them with a descriptive message referencing the MR or
   discussion, and push to the remote branch. (You can also refer to the `/git-commit` and `/git-push` workflows).

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: address review comments on MR"
   git push origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
   ```

2. **Reply to Discussions and Resolve** Once the code is pushed, use the `@mcp:gitlab-mr-discussions` tools to inform
   the reviewer.
   - Use `reply_to_mr_discussion` with the `project_id`, `mr_iid`, `discussion_id`, and your `body` text (e.g., "Fixed
     in the latest commit.").
   - Use `resolve_mr_discussion` with `resolve=True` to explicitly close the thread if the feedback has been fully
     addressed.

## Final Verification

Confirm with the user that all targeted discussions have been replied to and marked as resolved, and that the changes
were successfully pushed to GitLab.
